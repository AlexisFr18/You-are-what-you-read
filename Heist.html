    <p>When you, Katarina Bishop was three, your parents took you on a trip to the Louvre…to case it. For your seventh birthday, you and your Uncle Eddie traveled to Austria…to steal the crown jewels. When you turned fifteen, you planned a con of your own—scamming your way into the best boarding school in the country, determined to leave the family business behind. Unfortunately, leaving “the life” for a normal life proves harder than you’d expected.</p>
